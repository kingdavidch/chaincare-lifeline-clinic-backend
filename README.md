## Technical Stack

| SN  | Technology | Purpose           |
| --- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Node.js    | Backend runtime   |
| 2   | TypeScript | Strongly typed JS |
| 3   | MongoDB    | Database          |
| 4   | Express    | Backend framework |

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LifeLine-Africa/clinic-backend
```
````

### **Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables. Use the `.env.example` file as a template and create a `.env` file in the root directory.

### **Required Environment Variables**

| Variable Name | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`        | The port number for the server.            |
| `MONGO_URI`   | MongoDB connection string.                 |
| `JWT_SECRET`  | Secret key for JWT authentication.         |
| `NODE_ENV`    | Environment (`development`, `production`). |

---

## Running the Server

### **Development Mode**

To start the server in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### **Production Mode**

To start the server in production mode:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

## API Design

### **Style:**

- RESTful APIs with consistent versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).

### **Data Format:**

- JSON.

### **Security:**

- Use HTTPS for all endpoints.
- Token-based authentication (JWT).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (e.g., admin, user).

### **Error Handling:**

- Standard error codes with descriptive messages.

## Code Consistency and Automation

| Scope      | Tool     | Purpose                              |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Linter     | ESLint   | Enforce code quality.                |
| Formatter  | Prettier | Maintain consistent code formatting. |
| Pre-commit | Husky    | Ensure checks are passed pre-commit. |

**Rules:**

1. Pre-commit hooks must run ESLint and Prettier.
2. Modifications to automation configuration files are strictly prohibited.

## Collaboration Rules

| Rule                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use Git for version control.                                                                                        |
| Create task-specific branches using your name as a prefix (e.g., `test-feature`).                             |
| The `main` branch is reserved for production-ready code, with all development updates merged into the `dev` branch. |
| Submit a pull request for code review and request merging from the designated merger after completing tasks.        |
